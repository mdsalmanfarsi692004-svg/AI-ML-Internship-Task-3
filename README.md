# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the EDA analysis for the **Iris Dataset**.

## Project Overview
We analyzed the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.

## Key Insights
* **Clean Data:** No missing values found.
* **Correlations:** High correlation observed between Petal Length and Petal Width.
* **Separability:** Setosa species is easily separable from the others based on Petal dimensions.

## Files
* **Task_3_EDA.ipynb**: Code containing Histograms, Box Plots, and Heatmaps.
* **EDA_Report.pdf**: Summary of visual observations.
